The build4_Data folder and the build4 executable consist of a functioning game build, or a working system.  It's meant to serve as an example of what you can do using our framework.  To use this, download the executable and the build4_Data folder and put them in the same directory.  Run build4.exe to play.

The src folder contains just the code that we wrote for this project, organized by use and where we got it from or what we wrote it for.  

The Prototype archive contains a buildable Unity project folder, complete with the scenes and art assets, and the code in the src folder. Extracting everything in there and opening the Prototype folder in Unity 5.6 or later gives you access to everything that we had working on the game.  Be sure to include all three scenes in Build Settings.
