# Unity3D-Open-Source-AI-and-Procedural-Generation


The src folder contains just the code that we wrote for this project, organized by use and where we got it from or what we wrote it for.  

The Prototype archive contains a buildable Unity project folder, complete with the scenes and art assets. Extracting everything in there and opening the Prototype folder in Unity 5.6 or later gives you access to everything that we had working on the game.  Be sure to include all three scenes in Build Settings.
